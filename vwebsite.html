                        <p id="history">Valentine's Day traces its roots to both ancient Roman and Christian traditions. The holiday originated from the Roman festival of Lupercalia, a celebration of fertility held in mid-February. Over time, it became associated with the martyrdom of Saint Valentine, a Roman priest who defied an emperor's decree against marriage and continued to perform weddings in secret. Today, Valentine's Day is celebrated as a day to express love and affection through gestures like exchanging cards, gifts, and flowers.</p>
